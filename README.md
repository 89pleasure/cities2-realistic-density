## Resignation from the CS2 Modding Community

Dear Community,

With a heavy heart, I am announcing my resignation from the CS2 Modding Community. The decision comes as a result of the increasingly toxic atmosphere within the community, which has become intolerable for me.

Over the past few weeks and months, I have encountered numerous troubling incidents that have prompted me to take this step. These include instances of code theft, the spreading of false information and lies, as well as personal attacks against my character. Particularly distressing was being unfairly labeled as a conspiracy theorist for simply expressing constructive criticism of certain aspects within the modder community.

Furthermore, *I have been subjected to legal threats in an attempt to force me to make my code publicly accessible*, which is a stance I cannot condone.

Another issue I have faced is the lack of proper credit for my code when it was utilized by others.

In light of these challenges, I feel compelled to distance myself from the community to safeguard my mental well-being and integrity.

To ensure the continuity of my work, I have appointed an official maintainer for my mods. You can find him under the GitHub profile name [kosch104](https://github.com/kosch104) better known as [**Mimonsi**](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/authors/Mimonsi) on PDXMods.

It's important to note that my mod was not banned, but rather voluntarily removed by me. The current representation of all removed mods as banned on PDXMods is inaccurate.

Despite stepping back, I remain available on the linked Discord and welcome any questions or concerns.

I express my gratitude to all who have supported me throughout my tenure in the community and seek understanding regarding my decision.

Best regards,

89pleasure
